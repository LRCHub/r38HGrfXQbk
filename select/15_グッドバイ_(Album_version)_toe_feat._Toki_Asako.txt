There is no one can understand me truly
I don't go out, I will keep silence
Everyone is mania in general
You don't have
To know others

It's more complex than how I used to thought
But already I know
The start is the end
Everyone is mania in general
You don't have time to sleep
For to know others

Umaku todokanai nda
Mata tsugi no fuan ka?
A disruption and blinder
Sono saki wa nai nda
