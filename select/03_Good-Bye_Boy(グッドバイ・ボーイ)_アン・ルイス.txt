※Good-bye boy good-bye
It was really really good to know you
Good-bye boy good-bye
I was really really in love with you※

The days were like dreams
I wanted you, you wanted me

No one was there to bother us
Love was the only thing we had

Didn't need anything else
We had love, we had love, only love

Until that day, that hurtful day

Good-bye boy good-bye
You were truely truely the one to have
Good-bye boy good-bye
I was truely truely the one you had

No lies were around
It wasn't you, it wasn't me

Just a wind that passed through us
A cold sudden breeze

To tell us it was over
It was love, love, love, only love

Until that day, that hurtful day

(※くり返し×2)

Good-bye boy good-bye, so long
Good-bye boy good-bye, so long

Good-bye boy good-bye
I was really really in love with you
